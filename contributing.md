# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

---

Please ensure that:

- The submitted tool is related to webpack – not to web performance in general.

  If the tool is not related to webpack, you may want to submit it to the [`awesome-wpo`](https://github.com/davidsonfellipe/awesome-wpo) or [`webpack-libs-optimizations`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/webpack-libs-optimizations) repos.

- The submitted plugin or loader has at least 1000+ weekly downloads.

  There’re lots of useful tools out there, but including every webpack plugin into this repo will actually make it less helpful! To ensure the list stays helpful for most people, we’ve set the downloads limit as the acceptance criterion.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we’d like changed, we’ll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There’s no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you’re not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
